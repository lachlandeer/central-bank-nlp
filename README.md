# Central Bank NLP

A resource for natural language processing central bank communications. I hope it is useful. Please submit an issue if it is not or email me [john.rieth@outlook.com](john.rieth@outlook.com)

I have created word vectors using fastText from the usa-central-bank/fomc-statements folder. the vectors are  [text vectors](https://storage.googleapis.com/cbtext/fomc.vec) + [bin](https://storage.googleapis.com/cbtext/fomc.bin)


### Natural Language Processing

The notebook Sentiment Analysis R is where I am learning how to do text mining in R with the central bank text data. The spacy.ipynb notebook is for playing around with the [spacy python library](https://spacy.io/).

### Natural Language Generation

The folder nlg holds examples of natural language generation using the tools [rita](http://rednoise.org/rita/) and [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).
